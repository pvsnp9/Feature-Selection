#### Feature Selection Techniques

Feature selection is the process of reducing the number of input variables when developing a predictive model. It is desirable to reduce the number of input variables to both reduce the computational cost of modeling and, in many cases, to improve the performance of the model. Statistical-based feature selection methods involve evaluating the relationship between each input variable and the target variable using statistics and selecting those input variables that have the strongest relationship with the target variable. These methods can be fast and effective, although the choice of statistical measures depends on the data type of both the input and
output variables.


**There are two main types of Feature Selection:**

**- Supervised Selection:**  
Do not use the target variable (e.g. remove redundant variables). it is further categorized into three main categories. 
    
    **- Filter Method:**
